Official Correspondence Standards: The Carnegie Mellon University Letterhead

Version: 1.0

Applicability: All Faculty, Staff, and Student Organizations

Status: Mandatory for Official External Communication

1. Introduction & Purpose

To maintain the visual integrity of Carnegie Mellon University’s brand, all official correspondence must adhere to the strict layout specifications detailed below. This document defines the "pedantic" standards required to reproduce the official letterhead across any software platform (LaTeX, Microsoft Word, Typst, etc.).

Note: Visual approximation is insufficient. Adherence to typographic hierarchy and spatial relationships is required.

2. Page Configuration

2.1. Canvas Specifications

Paper Size: US Letter ($8.5" \times 11"$)

Orientation: Portrait

2.2. Margins

Uniformity is key to the clean, modernist aesthetic of the CMU brand.

Top Margin: $1.0"$ (approx. 25.4 mm)

Left Margin: $1.0"$ (approx. 25.4 mm)

Right Margin: $1.0"$ (approx. 25.4 mm)

Bottom Margin: $1.0"$ (approx. 25.4 mm)

3. Typography

3.1. Typeface

Primary Typeface: Open Sans

Usage: All body text, address blocks, and metadata.

Rationale: As explicitly stated in brand samples, Open Sans is the required sans-serif font for correspondence to ensure legibility and brand consistency.
