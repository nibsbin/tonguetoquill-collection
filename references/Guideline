Here is the updated, comprehensive guide to Carnegie Mellon University letterhead standards. This document focuses on the precise specifications and stylistic choices required to maintain professionalism and brand consistency, removing technical code implementation.
Carnegie Mellon University
Standardized Letterhead & Correspondence Guidelines
1. Design Philosophy
The official CMU "Lefthead" stationery relies on a modern, asymmetrical layout. Unlike traditional centered designs, this format uses a distinct vertical axis to separate institutional branding from personal correspondence.
 * The "Active" Margin: The wide left margin is not empty space; it is a dedicated column for the university identity (logo, department name, and address).
 * Visual Hierarchy: The body text sits to the right of this column, creating a clean, readable line that allows the content to stand out without visual clutter.
2. Technical Specifications
2.1. Page Geometry (The "Lefthead" Layout)
To replicate the official standard, document settings must adhere to these precise measurements.
| Dimension | Specification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Left Margin | 2.25 inches | This wide margin clears the logo and address block. |
| Right Margin | 1.0 inch | Standard business margin. |
| Top Margin | 1.0 inch |  |
| Bottom Margin | 1.0 inch |  |
| Alignment | Flush Left / Ragged Right | Never justify text. Uneven spacing between words disrupts readability. |
2.2. Typography
Consistency in typeface establishes the university's voice across different media.
 * Primary Typeface: Open Sans
   * Usage: All body text, dates, and recipient addresses.
   * Size: 10pt or 11pt (Do not exceed 11pt for body text; it appears juvenile).
   * Weight: Regular (Use Bold sparingly for headers; avoid italics).
 * Serif Alternative: Source Serif Pro
   * Usage: Formal invitations or highly traditional correspondence.
 * Acceptable Fallbacks:
   * If Open Sans is unavailable: Helvetica or Arial.
   * If Source Serif Pro is unavailable: Times New Roman.
2.3. Color Palette
Color should be used functionally to signal authenticity.
 * Carnegie Red (#C41230): Restricted to the University Wordmark and primary logo elements. Do not use for body text.
 * Iron Gray (#6D6E71): Preferred for footer text or secondary address information.
 * Black (#000000) or Dark Charcoal: The standard for all body correspondence.
3. Formatting & Structure
3.1. Paragraph Style
 * Format: Block Style.
 * Indentation: None. The first line of a paragraph should never be indented.
 * Spacing: Single line spacing (1.0 to 1.15).
 * Separation: Insert one full blank line (approx. 10–12pt) between paragraphs.
3.2. Structural Hierarchy
Follow this vertical progression for a standard letter:
 * Header (Left Column):
   * CMU Wordmark (Top Left).
   * Department Name.
   * Physical Address.
   * Web URL (e.g., cmu.edu).
 * Date Line:
   * Aligns with the body text margin (2.25" from left).
   * Format: Month Day, Year (e.g., November 29, 2025).
 * Recipient Block:
   * Place 2–4 lines below the date.
   * Includes Name, Title, Company/Institution, and Mailing Address.
 * Salutation:
   * Formal: Dear Dr. [Last Name], or Dear Professor [Last Name],
   * Business: Dear Mr./Ms. [Last Name],
 * Closing:
   * Sincerely, (Standard) or Regards, (Internal/Familiar).
   * Followed by 4 blank lines for a physical signature (or digital equivalent).
   * Sender’s Printed Name and Title.
4. Professional Standards & Best Practices
To achieve the "elegance" required of institutional documents, observe these stylistic rules:
 * Restrain Emphasis: Avoid using bold, italics, and underlining simultaneously. If emphasis is required, use bold sparingly. Never underline, as it cuts through letter descenders and looks dated.
 * Optimal Line Length: The 2.25" left margin naturally restricts the line length to 60–80 characters. This prevents eye fatigue and improves reader retention.
 * Signature Etiquette:
   * Do not use a "script" font to simulate a signature. It looks inauthentic.
   * Leave the space blank, or insert a high-quality scan of a wet-ink signature.
 * Paper Stock (If Printing):
   * Use 24lb or 28lb bond paper with slight cotton content.
   * Standard copier paper (20lb) is often too translucent for double-sided printing and lacks tactile authority.
 * Digital Metadata:
   * Before sending a PDF, ensure the "Title" field in Document Properties is professional (e.g., "Letter from Dean Smith") rather than a filename like "Draft_Final_v2.docx".
5. Writing Style Quick-Reference
 * Institution Name: Use "Carnegie Mellon University" on first reference. Use "Carnegie Mellon" or "CMU" on subsequent references.
 * Departments: Capitalize formal names (e.g., "School of Computer Science") but lowercase casual references (e.g., "the department").
 * Titles: Capitalize titles when they immediately precede a name (e.g., "President Jahanian"). Lowercase titles when following a name (e.g., "Farnam Jahanian, president of Carnegie Mellon").
