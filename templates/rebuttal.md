<!-- 1. INTRODUCTION -->
I received the Letter of Counseling dated _DD Month YYYY_ regarding being late to formation. I respectfully submit this response for your consideration.

<!--------------
2. SERVICE HISTORY
  Show you're an asset to the Air Force.
  - Time in service, AFSC, role
  - EPR ratings (quote strong language)
  - Awards with dates
  - Deployments, certifications, key achievements
-->

I respectfully request you consider my overall service record. I am a Cyber Transport technician with four years of service. I completed technical training with honors and have consistently supported mission-critical operations. My most recent EPR rated me a Firewall 5. During my time in this unit, I have earned Airman of the Quarter (September 2024) and the Air Force Achievement Medal (December 2024).

<!--
3. RESPONSE TO ALLEGATIONS
  Address each claim with facts and evidence.
  - If you didn't do it: state what actually happened (dates, times, actions), point out inaccuracies, reference evidence
  - If you did do it: acknowledge it professionally, explain circumstances without excuses, show it's isolated
  - Procedural errors: cite specific AFI and provide timeline
-->

I take full responsibility for being late and sincerely apologize. I experienced a vehicle issue that morning, but I recognize I should have planned for such contingencies.

<!--
4. MITIGATION AND REHABILITATION
  Show corrective actions taken since the incident.
  - Specific actions with dates and measurable results
  - Training completed, procedures changed, improved metrics
-->

Since this incident, I have adjusted my departure time to arrive 30 minutes early and established a vehicle maintenance schedule. I have had zero late arrivals in the 45 days since the incident.

<!--
5. CLOSING
  Request withdrawal or no PIF filing.
  - Explain impact if filed (promotion, clearance, reenlistment)
  - Reaffirm commitment to standards
-->

Based on my record of performance and corrective actions taken, I respectfully request that you do not file this letter in my personnel information file. I remain committed to maintaining the standards of conduct expected of me and will continue to serve with professionalism. Thank you for your consideration.
