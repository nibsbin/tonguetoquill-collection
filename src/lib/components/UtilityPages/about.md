# About Us

## Welcome to Tongue to Quill

When drafting documents ranging from corporate memos to meeting minutes and class notes, we often spend much of our most productive waking moments correcting formatting and fixing glitches introduced by MS Word. How many times have you copied text from the internet into your document, only discover right before your deadline that the font was 1 pt. larger than the rest of your paragraph? Or your bulleted list won't move all the way left, because of some hidden "feature"? TongueToQuill was born to solve these issues, allowing you to focus on the content and not the tedium.

As we release this project into the wild, we're curious to hear your thoughts - the good, bad, and the ugly! Please reach out to us at: **support@tonguetoquill.com**

## Meet the Team

### John Pan: The Fearless Leader

John was raised in Texas but cooks fish on the stove. We still don't know why he doesn't grill. When he's not serving the country through his cybersecurity work at the US Air Force, he's busy bouldering and searching for meaining in a post-AI world. He was frustrated with writing a 5-minute memo in the Air Force, and has been devoted to building TTQ so that he could reduce that to 3.78 minutes.
