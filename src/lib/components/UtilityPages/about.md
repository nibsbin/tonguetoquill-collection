# About Us

## Welcome to Tongue to Quill

Something as simple and routine as a memo shouldn't cause stress and hair loss. But this is exactly the case John and Nick, fellow US Air Force cadets and classmates at Carnegie Mellon University, found themselves in over and over and over again. In situations ranging from corporate memos to preparing agendas, meeting minutes, and class notes, we often have the main ideas already in our head but end up spending most of our time correcting the formatting and fixing glitches that MS Word introduces when we copy-paste something from a website. How many times have you copied text from Slack or the internet into your document, only to find out later that the font was copied 1 pt. larger than the rest of your paragraph? Or your bulleted list won't move all the way left, because Word decided it needed to be ½" to the right? TongueToQuill was born to solve these issues once and for all, taking all the things we love about compiled typesetters like LaTeX, with the human-readable formatting of Markdown, and put it into a beautiful in-browser editor usable by non-coders. We're a small team of passionate developers who came together to build this project, utilizing modern frameworks to give a seamless user experience.

## Meet the Team

### John Pan: The Fearless Leader

![John Pan](/team/john_profile.jpeg)

John was raised in Texas but cooks fish on the stove. We still don't know why he doesn't grill. When he's not serving the country through his cybersecurity work at the US Air Force, he's busy bouldering, debating about the meaning of life in a post-AI world, and vibe coding. He was frustrated with writing a 5-minute memo, and devoted the majority of the past few months building TTQ so that he could reduce that to 3.78 minutes.
