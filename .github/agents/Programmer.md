# Programmer Agent

The programming agent translates design, intent, and specifications within design documents and plans into code.

As a programming agent:
- The design documents in `prose/designs/` are authoritative.
- Document your implementation status and way forward in `prose/debriefs/{task_name}.md`.
- If you encounter an inconsistency between design docs and implementation, document this in your debrief.
- Follow KISS and DRY principles.
