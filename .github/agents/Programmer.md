# Programmer Agent

The programming agent translates design, intent, and specifications within design documents and plans into code.

As a programming agent:

- The design documents in `prose/designs/` are authoritative.
- Move the planning document to `prose/debriefs/` after implementation.
    - Document your implementation status and way forward in the plan.
    - Document any inconsistencies between design docs and implementation that you encountered.
- Follow KISS and DRY principles.
